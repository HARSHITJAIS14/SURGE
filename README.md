# SURGE

## Week 1
In week 1 we tried to basically get familier with the working and flow of LLMs. We went through all the stages of LLM creation i.e pretraining, supervised- finetuning and finally reinforcement learning and RLHF.
We tried to cover the following resources:
1. [Busy Person's Intro to LLMS](https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=EEgU8appT5EwWb9n)
2. [ Deep dive into LLMs](https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=4T-RtDVmZLvDNrjM)
3. [Basics of Prompting](https://youtu.be/1Faf1cTe3T8?si=aKsLxljDJJGr5s-e)
4. [OpenAI API calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
